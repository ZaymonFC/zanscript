## Zanscript

This repository is for the toy language Zanscript which I am basing off the Monkey language from [Writing An Interpreter In Go](www.interpreterbook.com).

I'm implementing this in Clojure with the goals of:
- Understanding Clojure more deeply
- Gain more understanding around the implementation of languages and common language features like closures and higher order functions.

My goal is to reach feature parity with Monkey and add a few more interesting features:

- [x] Question mark in variable names
- [ ] Lexical analysis errors that print messages and source to the terminal
- [ ] Think of more! ðŸ˜‚
